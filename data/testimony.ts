        statement: "Aayush's contributions to the admissions team at NYU Abu Dhabi are immeasurable. He has proactively and tirelessly pursued every opportunity to improve the efficiency of our work. Prior to the considerable challenges our campus faced due to the COVID restrictions and throughout a prolonged disruption we experienced due to these restrictions, Aayush has innovated ways to keep our team engaged and working. Aayush developed an automated system which allowed our global team to collaborate across offices in New York, London, Abu Dhabi, Shanghai and other locations. This system actually increased the scope of our students' engagement in virtual events and has now become a cornerstone of our program. Aayush diligence and enthusiasm has been a source of inspiration and strength for our team, students and staff alike as we continue to adapt to ongoing challenges and most recently a return to in person work in addition to expanding the breadth of our virtual offerings. The entire NYU Abu Dhabi admissions team owes him a debt of gratitude for his commitment."
